        <p><strong>Winning:</strong>   
        The game ends when a player successfully forms a line of four connected discs.
        <br><br>
        The line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
        <br><br>
        The player who achieves this first is declared the winner.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Draw:</strong>
        If the entire board is filled with discs, and no player has connected four in a row, the game is a draw.</p>
